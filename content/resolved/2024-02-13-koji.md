Koji is unavailable during F40 mass branching. All builds that will be running at
that time for the rawhide will be canceled and can be resubmitted by maintainers
after the branching.

Once Fedora Linux 40 is branched we will reenable builds in Koji.

F40 is branched, koji is enabled now, should be back up and processing now.
